# signal-md

Signal to Markdown tool which utilizes [signald](https://signald.org/) export to JSON function.

Check out the user [guide](docs/guide.md) for how to configure the tool.

## Dependencies

The code in this repo relies heavily on my [message_md](https://github.com/thephm/message_md) classes which contain generic `Message`, `Person`, `Group` and other classes and the methods to convert messages to Markdown files. Be sure to read the README and the configuration guide for that repo first.
